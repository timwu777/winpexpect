This is WinPexpect, a version of Pexpect that works on Unix and Windows.

Version 1.x of WinPexpect was a port to Windows of Noah Spurrier's excellent
pexpect project [1]_. It included a modified copy of pexpect.

Version 2.x of WinpExpect is a rewrite that does not use any of the pexpect
code anymore, but it still tries to implement the pexpect interface.

Installation via setuptools::

  $ python setup.py install

To run the tests, you need Nose [2]_. To run them, use::

  $ python setup.py test
